 //   PROBLEM 1:
    
//    Given the following code:
    
    const foo = 1;
    function run() {
        const foo = 2;
    }
    
    run();
    console.log(foo); // what is foo? why? foo is 
/* REWRITTEN/ ANSWER: 
const foo = 1; //global
    function run() {
        const foo = 2; //local 
    }
    
 run();
console.log(foo); // what is foo? why? 
//ANSWER: depends on how the variable are being declared. const in line 21 is not going to change const! no error is shown because global and local are 2 diff varables. 
//21 creates a variable, 22 creates a function but doesnt read what s inside a function...just made it nothing in line 25. 26runs the function...the comp goes back and sees whats inside now in line 23 it shows const 2 just an assignment. 
//in order to get something outside of a function we need a return key! RETURN key! 
//line 27 looks at global value in line 21 because the local variable is not affecting the global variable.
//therefore foo prints to be 1 because it is console.logging outside of the local scope */

    function run() {
        const foo = 2;

    run();
    console.log(foo); // what is foo? why?

/*REWRITTEN/ANSWER: 
function run() {
     const foo = 2; //if we remove const we get 2 ***because (look at Tak's rules) ****when a variable is not declared inside of a function it goes up one level up and since there is nothing there foo is now the global variable.

}
run();

/*let foo = 1;

    run();

//-------------------------------------------------------  PROBLEM 9:
    
//Given the following code:

    run();
    console.log(foo); // what is foo? why? 1 looks at global definition where there is a const variable of foo defined to 1. const means not allowed to redefine that variable value

//-------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM 9b:
    
// Given the following code:
    
    let foo = 1; //global foo
    function run() {
        function _inner() { //no eplicit definition goes up one scope to run but not explicitly defined there therefore goes up another scope 
            console.log(foo); // what is foo? why? 1 computer wont recognize 10 because javascript reads from the top. only recognizes foo at global where if there is no local definition of the console log at a local ***before console log is written, then it will go to global scope.

        }
        _inner();
    }
    
    run();
    console.log(foo); // what is foo? why? 10 because it is replacing the global variable since the global variable was defined with let and not const 


//

//Given the following code:
    
    let foo = 1; //global.foo

    run(function() {
        foo = 2; //global.foo

                      //written before, it is encapsulated inside the run function. foo is written with let globally, hence it is replced with a 2 from ine 254 therefore, once invoked 
                      //in line 253, it will print the foo of 2 from 254. 


//
//-------------------------------------------------------------PROBLEM 11:
    
//Given the following code:
    
    let foo = 1;           //global.foo
    function run( anotherFunctionToCall ) {
        const foo = 9;      //run.foo

    run(function() {
        foo = 2;     //global.foo
    });
    console.log(foo); // what is foo? why? 9 and 2 this foo is 2. because it is going to console log the response from the function encapsulated inside since there is a console.log 
                      //there is a let global variable that allows the run function to replace the original global foo value of 1
                      //foo is being redeclared as a variable to be 2 inside this function

//---------------------------------------------- PROBLEM 12:
    
//Given the following code:

    run(function() {
        foo = 2;       //global foo for lines 287-290
    });
    console.log(foo); // what is foo? why? foo will console log 2 twice because the function in line 293 redefines the global scope in 286 to be 2 since it has a let variable definition 
                      //foo is not replaced by 9 because of anotherFunctionToCall is invoking the foo in 289. that function however does not declare any variable for foo. goes to its global in line 294.
